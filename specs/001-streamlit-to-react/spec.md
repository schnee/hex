# Feature Specification: Streamlit to React Conversion

**Feature Branch**: `001-streamlit-to-react`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "convert from streamlit to react with a python based REST backend"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Users can access the same hexagonal tile layout generation and visualization functionality through a modern React web application instead of the current Streamlit interface, with improved interactivity and performance for the overlay visualization tool.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the React application, **When** they access the pattern generator, **Then** they can configure all the same parameters (aspect ratio, colors, tendrils) as in the current Streamlit version
2. **Given** a user generates patterns, **When** they switch to the overlay view, **Then** they can upload wall images and interactively position/scale the pattern overlay with smooth drag-and-drop
3. **Given** a user has positioned an overlay, **When** they resize it, **Then** the physical dimensions update in real-time and maintain proper aspect ratio locking
4. **Given** a user completes their design, **When** they download the pattern, **Then** they receive the same high-quality PNG output as the current system

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploaded images are too large or invalid formats?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during pattern generation?
- What occurs when users have multiple browser tabs open with different patterns?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a React frontend that replicates all current Streamlit functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST expose pattern generation through REST API endpoints
- **FR-003**: System MUST support file upload for wall images with automatic resizing
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide smooth drag-and-drop overlay positioning without server round-trips
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain the same mathematical algorithms for hex generation and color assignment
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate identical PNG outputs to the current Streamlit version
- **FR-007**: System MUST support real-time dimension calculations during overlay manipulation
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle multiple pattern generations in a single session
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide pattern download functionality identical to current system
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain backwards compatibility with existing pattern generation parameters

### Key Entities
- **Pattern**: Generated hexagonal layout with metadata (dimensions, colors, aspect ratio)
- **LayoutParams**: Configuration object containing all generation parameters
- **OverlayState**: Position, scale, and transform data for pattern visualization
- **WallImage**: Uploaded background image with processed metadata
- **GenerationRequest**: API request containing all pattern generation parameters
